# Using Google translate API to try and remove plagiarism by repeatedly translating text into different languages.
I came across [this paper from 2014](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271943774_Back_translation_an_emerging_sophisticated_cyber_strategy_to_subvert_advances_in_'digital_age'_plagiarism_detection_and_prevention) that talks about this technique so 6 years down the line, I thought why not create a python script to test how it works. I personally think this is a pretty bad way to plagiarize since the output contains quite a lot of grammatical mistakes and so the user has to do quite a lot of work anyways to rectify all of them. Well, after building this script and testing various files, it is quite clear that it's much better to NOT waste time using this technique to plagiarize and instead do the work on your own.  

## Usage:
1. Download the repo (or clone it)
2. Open cmd, bash or whatever you use, go to the repo in your device and type
	`python plagiarism.py`
3. You will be prompted to enter your file name
4. A new file will be automatically generated containing the finl output. You can use that to compute plagiarism percentage between original and translated file.

### Note
This was just a for-fun project, please don't use this irresponsibly and even if you do (not that I condone it), do it at your own risk.
