# Using Google translate API to try and remove plagiarism by repeatedly translating text into different languages.

## Usage:
1. Download the repo (or clone it)
2. Open cmd, bash or whatever you use, go to the repo in your device and type
	`python plagiarism.py`
3. You will be prompted to enter your file name
4. A new file will be automatically generated containing the finl output. You can use that to compute plagiarism percentage between original and translated file.

### Note
This is just a for-fun project, please don't use this irresponsibly and even if you do (not that I condone it), do it at your own risk.
